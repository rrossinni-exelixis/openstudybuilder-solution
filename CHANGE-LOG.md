## V 2.2

New Features and Enhancements
============

### Fixes and Enhancements

- When a user updates the name of the group or subgroup, and approves it, then the linkage of the approved group or subgroup does NOT lose the activities linked to the previous version.
- The red bells appear in the 'Detailed SoA' and the 'Operational SoA' only when the actions are needed for the users.
- Field Customization Persistence: Replaced a page reload mechanism for saving field customizations (NCI Name, Submission Name, ADAM Code, Topic Code). The customizations are now saved locally, ensuring they persist without losing user changes.
- ADAM Parameter Auto-Fill: Resolved bugs related to the automatic population of ADAM parameters, improving data accuracy and consistency during the wizard flow.

- For each study in OpenStudyBuilder, the data supplier(s) must be defined to ensure traceability of the data origin (for example, which EDC system the study is using or which laboratory vendor is delivering clinical results to the sponsor). To capture data-supplier information at the study level, a new page (Study Data Supplier) has been added under Manage Study. On this page, users can link a supplier from the library (Admin Definitions, Data Supplier) to a specific data type, or if the supplier is not yet present, add a new supplier.
- It is possible to compare different versions of library CRFs.
- CRF release notes can be viewed and extracted from the neodash report: CRF Library Versions.

This has been changed so all aggregate definition of CRF collections, forms, item groups and items now is based on versioned relationships when these are in final state. When editing these in draft state the reference will always be to the latest draft version. Be aware that when you want to use a new version of an element, then you need also to modify the parent.
- Enhancements to the wizard stepper now allow the linking of activity instances with sponsor values, including codelists like LBTEST/LBTESTCD.
- The selection of the --TEST/TESTCD codelist is now possible for instance classes that represent categorical and textual findings.
- The option to add and edit a requested activity from the 'Requested Activities' page in the Library has been removed

## V 0.14

### Fixes and Enhancements

- Refactored the way we store end-user information so that we can properly identify and maintain unique users of the system.   Instead of just storing user initials, we now store user's id, username, name and other relevant information embedded in their JWT (authentication token).  In the UI we are now displaying username instead of initials of each change author.
- Ensuring that the Protocol SoA design doesn't changed for a locked study over time.
- Consistency requirement has been build in for the use of visit window time units across visits in a study. The visit window unit selected for the first visit created in a study will be used for all subsequent visits added to that study.
- The data model for activity instances has been expanded with properties for molecular weight, research lab and NCI concept names.
- The Activity Instance table now includes Activity Groups and Activity Subgroups. Updates to the sponsor import script to follow changes in the API Stricter validation of required text fields, such as name, to ensure that the text fields do not have redundant white spaces. This will improve the content quality of the StudyBuilder database. Improved handling of batch operations in the API, this ensures that the entire batch operation either succeeds or fails as a  whole. Various quality improvements in the API for easier maintenance and better stability
- We have implemented a new Boolean field to indicate complex unit conversion, and "molecular weight" has been included as an activity instance property. Please note that the feature implementation is ongoing, and additional updates will be released in upcoming versions.
- Alias is a temporary solution to hold Veeva internal identifiers, until an actual Veeva namespace is implemented.
- Updates to the import scripts and import data to prepare for the future activity instance wizard stepper, this is mostly relevant while developing the StudyBuilder application. Added extensions to the API to support the upcoming activity instance wizard stepper.
- Removed "Process Overview" screen as it did not add value as the process steps can be followed along the navigation menu

### New Features

- Leveraging USDM JSON metadata, we have added a new page to the Frontend displaying the ICH M11 template alongside the current metadata.
- It is now possible to bulk edit and bulk delete activities from the Detailed SoA.    A bulk edit and bulk delete button has been introduced in upper right hand corner of the Detailed SoA page. To use the bulk feature select the activities by clicking in the selection boxes in front of the activity and click on the Bulk action button and follow the guide on the screen. Only allowed edits (e.g. SoA group, Visit) will be possible via the screen.
- It is now possible to add a new activity directly from the Detailed SoA. This is done by clicking on the three small dots in front of an activity. Then select 'Add activity' from the pop-up and follow the flow.
- Configuring a new Neodash report entails presenting a Pre-define.xml report specifically tailored to a designated Study. This report includes a dataset list, SDTM variables, and, when relevant, a list of CT terms. These metadata selections are derived from the chosen ActivityInstance originating from the Schedule of Activity.
- Introducing the DDF USDM to StudyBuilder data model mapping for version 3.6. More technical adjustments on API layer will commence in further release.

New Features and Enhancements
============

### Fixes and Enhancements

- It is now possible to exchange an activity directly on the Detailed SoA page by clicking the three dots in front of the activity.
- The Consumer API version 1 has been extended with two new GET endpoints: /studies/{uid}/detailed-soa /studies/
- The disclosure information from OpenStudyBuilder can now be downloaded as an XML file for upload to PharmaCM Specification.
- The SoA group for an activity can now be edited from the Detailed SoA page.
- Neodash dashboards are changed from Neo4j style to OpenStudyBuilder style.
- Clean-up of the API code to improve readability and maintainability. The API has been upgraded to run on Python 3.13.0 from 3.11.0.  The Study Visits endpoint in the Consumer API version 1 has been improved to give a relevant response for studies with no visits defined. Minor improvements to the CRF module in the Library. The title of the middle step of the "Add SoA footnotes" stepper has been changed from 'Create template' to 'Create footnote' to indicate that when creating a footnote from scratch it's not a template.  In the Unlink footnote pop-up window, that comes when hovering over an activity with a footnotes and pressing the "-" sign, the wording has been updated to make it more clear that the footnote is being unlinked from this particular activity. The previous wording could be interpreted as the footnote was going to be completely deleted. The Clinical Programmes & Projects pages under Admin Definitions in the library have been improved by adding filtering and column selection buttons. Further a title has been added to the two pages to align with the general look and feel of StudyBuilder.

### New Features

- A new menu option (Need help?) has been added to the Help menu (? icon) to allow navigation to the https://openstudybuilder.com/ site.
- In the Library a new Study Structures overview page is introduced. It will assist Standards Developers by offering an overview of how existing trials have been defined and allows users to view the study structures they can replicate, identify trends, and spot any deviations. The Study Structures page aims to increase consistency when setting up new trials. Studies that share the same structure are grouped together and listed in the table under the same row. The columns display numeric values indicating the number of arms/epochs/elements in the trial or Y/N to indicate if cohorts are part of the trial design.
- To facilitate that the different StudyBuilder environments are used for their intended purposes the top bar and front page of StudyBuilder environments: Development, Test, Preview, Validation and Education will now clearly indicate what environment the user is about to log on to.
- A feature toggle has been implemented to allow a StudyBuilder administrator to toggle on/off the "Analysis Study Metadata (New)" page under View Listings in the Studies module.
- New Neodash Dashboard for Activity Metadata Check.

## V 0.12.1

New Features and Enhancements
============

This release does not include any new features.

Solved Bugs
============

## V 0.12

New Features and Enhancements
============

### Fixes and Enhancements

- Minor visual changes have been made to the System Announcement functionality to increase readability
- The edit "Activity Instance" form has been rewritten so it only fetches up to 20 activities instead of all (1000+) activities. This makes the form usable after a fraction of a second instead of the more than 20 seconds it used to take. The parameters in the URL path has gotten a unified naming scheme making the API easier to use for API users. In the "Add Visits" form it is now more intuitive for Standard Developers what information needs to be filled out when creating a visit meant to be a Global Anchor visits.  The Protocol SoA no longer shows "+/-" in front of a time window value of 0. Neomodel has been upgraded to version 5.3
- Various quality improvements by increased coverage of automated tests for the System Announcements functionality.
- The online help has been updated to include details about selection by Study Acronym.
- Footnotes can now be managed from the SoA table directly.
- Backend updates have been implemented to prepare for the need to save the Protocol SoA in a new database design. No changes to the frontend or impact on end users.
- Backend updates have been implemented to prepare for the ability to edit activity grouping
- Up-versioning an Activity now retains the existing links between Activities and Activity Instances. This significantly improves the time spend on managing Activities for Standards Developers as it requires 10 mouse clicks to to add a link to an Activity Instance from an Activity
- Under manage study StudyBuilder now support selection of Sponsor and CDISC CT Package. This selection will control display and submission values for study selections related to sponsor and/or CDISC CT.
- Updated activity instance classes and activity item classes.

### New Features

- Implemented API endpoints to read and write the state of feature flags, which are simple toggles for enabling or disabling selected parts of the application. The features in question can be anything from a complete module, such as the "Compounds" module under Library/Concepts, or something much smaller as a single button in a form. Once fully implemented this will allow us to perform more targeted user research (e.g. A/B testing) as well as allow the open source community to configure what parts of the application to use.
- The first version of the consumer API has been initiated and contains three endpoints to get a list of studies, a list of study visits for a study and an operational SoA for a study.
- It is now possible to remove an activity directly from the Detailed Schedule of Activities (SoA) page
- In the Studies part of the application the menu option 'Clinical Transparency' has been added. The new menu ensures the transparency information needed for upload to clinicaltrial.gov is made available in a downloadable format.

- CDISC USDM generation is now integrated into the native API and can also be displayed and downloaded under the menu Studies -> View Specifications -> USDM.
- Introducing a new visit subclass called Repeating visit, which can typically be used in non-interventional studies. It is useful when participants need to return for the same visit multiple times based on their individual needs (for example, one participant may come to visit 3 five times, while another may have 10 visits as visit 3). If there are any requirements about the repetition of such visits (daily, weekly, monthly), then it can be defined via the Repeating frequency item. Note that Repeating visits should be used if you do not know in advance the number of repeats that will occur. If a fixed number of similar visits is planned, then these should be created as single scheduled visits and grouped in a consecutive visit group. Please find more details in the StudyBuilder Documentation Portal.
- Compound API partly prepared for refactoring, but functionality is not yet enabled for use.
- The API supports returning study selections related to sponsor and CDISC CT for the specific CT package selected for the study.
- It is now possible to edit and delete Clinical Programmes and Project on the Admin Definitions pages in Library.
- Study Visits can be marked as a SoA milestone, and then the related visit type can be displayed in the protocol SoA table header. On the protocol SoA page you can decide to display the SoA milestone, the study epochs, or both. The SoA milestones can also be displayed on the Study Design figure.
- Various performance improvements for Activities in Library
- When adding a study visit, the list of "Existing visits Names and Timing" can now show visit timing as either Week or Day depending on what "Time unit" the user selects in the Add study visit form. A sticky bar has been added to all History pages making actions for download or closing the window easy available at all times without the need for scrolling.
- When adding Activities from other studies it is now possible to search for a study to select from by using its acronym instead of the study id.
- Selected components in tables (eg. search fields, filter, dropdowns and action buttons) of the StudyBuilder user interface have been aligned to the Novo Nordisk design system to increase the visual consistency of the user interface.
- Front-end refreshes data from the back-end on switching pages/tabs
- Redesign of the Schedule of Activities and the footnotes section has been initiated. Among other improvements several of the SoA tabs have been combined into one tab.

## New Features

- New Neodash report to search and list CT code list and terms with history evolution over time.
- First version of StudyBuilder Consumer API exposing GET /studies endpoint
- A "Reports" button have been added to the top bar. Clicking this button opens a landing page in a new tab where existing NeoDash reports and dashboards are available. These reports can be used to deep dive in the standards and study information available in the StudyBuilder database.
