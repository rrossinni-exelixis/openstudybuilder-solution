## Quick Reference

**Start Development:**
```bash
pipenv sync --dev
cp .env.example .env  # Edit NEO4J_DSN, UID
pipenv run dev        # Start main API (localhost:8000)
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
pipenv run testunit   # Unit tests
pipenv run testint    # Integration tests (requires Neo4j)
pipenv run test       # All tests
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
pipenv run format     # Auto-format code
pipenv run lint       # Run Pylint
pipenv run mypy       # Type checking
```
