    ## Fix Activity_000317 versioning gap (Bug #3221548)

    ### Problem description
    Activity_000317 has a 36-day chronological gap in its HAS_VERSION relationships
    between version 7.0 and version 7.1. Version 7.0 ends on 2024-11-14T15:20:11.139020Z
    but version 7.1 doesn't start until 2024-12-20T12:41:58.289320Z, creating a gap
    from November 14 to December 20, 2024. This violates the rule that versions should
    be chronologically continuous without gaps.

    ### Change description
    - Extend the end_date of version 7.0's HAS_VERSION relationship from
      2024-11-14T15:20:11.139020Z to 2024-12-20T12:41:58.289320Z
    - This ensures continuous versioning between version 7.0 and 7.1
    - The correction is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely

    ### Nodes and relationships affected
    - `HAS_VERSION` relationship for Activity_000317 version 7.0

    In StudyBuilder before 2.0, submision values had to be globaly unique.

    With StudyBuilder 2.0, submission values only need to be unique within their codelist,

    It should only have added a new HAS_VERSION relationship with status "Retired" to an the existing latest value node.
    As a result, some value nodes are linked to their root nodes only by a HAS_VERSION relationship with status "Retired",
    without a corresponding "Final" or "Draft" HAS_VERSION relationship.
