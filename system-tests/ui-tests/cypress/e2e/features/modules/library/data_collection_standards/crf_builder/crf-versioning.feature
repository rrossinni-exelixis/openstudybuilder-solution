    ## 1 Hierarchical Structure: CRF Collection → Forms → Item Groups → Items                                                                                                                  ##
    ## 2 Basic Business Rules:                                                                                                                                                                 ##           
    ##      2.1 Parent in Draft Status (Not locked) -> Parents always connect to the latest version of the child, updates in the child version automatically reflect on the parent connection. ##
    ##      2.2 Parent in Final Status (Locked) -> Parent connects to the old version of the child, updates in the child version do not affect the parent's connection.                        ##
