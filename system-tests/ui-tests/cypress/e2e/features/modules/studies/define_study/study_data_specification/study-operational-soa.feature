Feature: Studies - Define Study - Study Data Specifications - Operational SoA

    As a system user,
    I want the system to ensure [Scenario],
    So that I can make complete and consistent specification of the Study Operational SoA.

    # Note, data collection specification is not impemented yet, so currently only the study activity instance and operational SoA is supported.
    # See also file: study-activity-instance.feature

    Background: User is logged in and study has been selected
        Given The user is logged in
        And A test study is selected

    Scenario: [TestData] All activities are deleted from test study
        And [API] All Activities are deleted from study

        When The 'Data Specifications' submenu is clicked in the 'Define Study' section
        When The 'Operational SoA' tab is selected
        Then The current URL is '/data_specifications/operational'

    @smoke_test
    Scenario: [Table][Columns][Names] User must be able to see the Operational SoA matrix table with options listed in this scenario
        Given The test study '/data_specifications/operational' page is opened
        Then expand table and Show SoA groups is available on the page
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers             |
            | Activities          |

            | Window              |
            | Topic Code          |
            | ADaM Param Code     |


    Scenario: [Placeholder][Submitted] User must be able to see highlighted (yellow) submitted placeholder in the Operational SoA
        Given The test study '/activities/list' page is opened
        When Study activity add button is clicked
        And Activity from placeholder is selected
        And Form continue button is clicked
        And User selects option to create placeholder with submitting
        When Activity placeholder data is filled in
        And Form save button is clicked
        And The form is no longer available
        And The test study '/data_specifications/operational' page is opened
        And User waits Operational SoA table
        And User expand table
        Then Row containing submitted placeholder is highlighted with yellow color in Operational SoA 

    Scenario: [Placeholder][Not-Submitted] User must be able to see highlighted (orange) not-submitted placeholder in the Operational SoA
        Given The test study '/activities/list' page is opened
        When Study activity add button is clicked
        And Activity from placeholder is selected
        And Form continue button is clicked
        And User selects option to create placeholder without submitting
        When Activity placeholder data is filled in
        And Form save button is clicked
        And The form is no longer available
        And The test study '/data_specifications/operational' page is opened
        And User waits Operational SoA table
        And User expand table
        Then Row containing unsubmitted placeholder is highlighted with orange color in Operational SoA

        When The test study activity instances is selected for the study
        And the option to 'Show SoA groups' is enabled
        Then The Operational SoA table matrix display rows for each test study activity instance grouped by activity, activity group, activity subgroup and SoA group

    @pending_implementation
    Scenario: User must be able to view the study activity instance in the Operational SoA table matrix without SoA groups
        Given The test study '/data-specification/detailed-detailed-operational-soa' page is opened
