        And [API] The Study Arm exists within the study
        And [API] Uids are fetched for element subtype 'Run-in'
        And [API] Element is created for the test study
        And [API] Uids are fetched for element subtype 'Treatment'
        And [API] Element is created for the test study

    Scenario: [Navigation] User must be able to open the page for Study Design Matrix

        When The 'Study Structure' submenu is clicked in the 'Define Study' section
        And The 'Design Matrix' tab is selected
        Then The current URL is '/study_structure/design_matrix'

    Scenario: [Table][Columns][Names] User must be able to see the page structure for Study Design Matrix
        Given The test study '/study_structure/design_matrix' page is opened
        Then A table is visible with following headers
            | headers          |
            | Study Arm        |
