Example could be first human dose-escalation studies where increasing doses are given until stopping criteria are met. Some dose-escalation studies enroll a new cohort of subjects (a new group of subjects) for each new dose. Cohorts are also used for observational studies where no randomisation takes place or single arm randomised study. Then cohorts are being defined based on some characteristics and comparisons are made between the different cohorts, e.g. treatment of a drug in subjects with a liver disease compared to a group of healthy subjects. Cohorts are not the same as strata. Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling/randomisation. If the study with liver diseased and healthy subjects had to examine the effect of a drug compared to placebo then liver diseased/healthy would be a stratification factor, since it is expected that the treatment responses will be different in the two groups. Stratification is made to ensure homogeneity of the groups in which the treatments are being compared."
